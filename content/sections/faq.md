  - question: What is so special about Supernova?
    answer: If you are leading a growth stage company ($5MM to $100MM+), then you
      already know it doesn't get any easier the bigger you get. Scaling teams,
      entering new markets, bridging financing rounds, M&A, etc. The founders’
      journey to go the distance can be crazy complicated, but it doesn’t have
      to be. Our mission at Supernova is to accelerate the realization of the
      founder's vision from the only perspective that truly understands the
      journey, as exited founders ourselves. Stacking successfully exited
      founders on your team is a game-changer. They supply shortcuts, and cheat
      codes and help solve problems to help you get unstuck and accelerate
      speed-to-value. They fill specific needs - guidance, expertise,
      connections, mentorship, coaching and can even get hands-on serving in
      interim roles or tiger teams. 70% of unicorns were built by repeat
      founders of at least one previously successful company. That's why
      founders with multiple exits still tag in Supernova despite their past
      success because they know the advantage it brings when scaling their
      companies successfully.
  - question: How can apply to Supernova?
    answer: Founders can apply online to see where they measure up and explore
      whether Supernova is the right partner. Each year, we selectively back
      10–12 scaleups—typically Series A–C companies or bootstrapped businesses
      with $5M+ in ARR. For these companies, we deploy up to $1M+ in capital,
      paired with a hands-on tiger team of successfully exited founders focused
      on accelerating the milestones that matter most. For earlier-stage
      companies that stand out, we may engage before investing by deploying one
      or more exited founders to build relationships, pressure-test strategy,
      and help unlock key inflection points. Supernova is sector-agnostic, with
      a strong track record across AI, HealthTech, Fintech, SaaS, eCommerce,
      Impact, and Web3. Above all, we are drawn to mission-driven founders
      tackling meaningful, modern-day problems and building companies that
      create lasting value for humanity.
  - question: How much does Supernova invest?
    answer: Every portfolio company in Supernova’s fund receives a check (up to
      $1M+). More importantly, each company is paired with 3–5 successfully
      exited founders, including Super Founders with prior exits of $50M+, who
      roll up their sleeves and work hands-on to accelerate critical milestones.
      As the saying goes, wisdom is more precious than gold. We don’t just
      invest capital—we transfer lived experience, especially when the stakes
      involve million-dollar decisions. Supernova is the top-rated
      advisory-as-a-service platform (90%+ NPS), with a proven track record of
      helping companies scale to unicorn and decacorn outcomes. Together, we
      build enduring companies and a legacy that extends far beyond business
      success.
  - question: What if I don’t have time for Supernova?
    answer: "Our guiding North Star is TIME. We don’t waste it—yours, your team’s,
      or our exited founders’. In fact, we invented Advisory-as-a-Service™ to
      formalize and streamline elite mentorship and advisory support. We start
      by precisely matching each Supernova exited founder to a member of your
      C-suite. For example, your CMO is paired with a successfully exited
      founder whose zone of genius directly addresses your most pressing
      opportunities and challenges. Leadership teams typically invest 5–10 hours
      per month and gain disproportionate returns through direct knowledge
      transfer—hard-won wisdom, pattern recognition, resources, and trusted
      relationships. Our founders are often brought in at moments that involve
      million-dollar decisions, helping teams move faster, avoid costly
      mistakes, and compound progress over time. If you feel “too busy” for
      Supernova, that’s usually the signal you need us most. "
  - question: Why do successfully exited founders join Supernova?
    answer: Supernova shares similarities with organizations like YPO—intimate,
      high-trust peer groups that serve as powerful sounding boards. The
      difference is that at Supernova, successfully exited founders don’t just
      talk about the game—they get back on the field together, helping scale
      real companies and sharing in the upside of successful outcomes. We are a
      peer network of 250+ exited founders who believe that, together, we can
      catalyze far more growth and impact than any of us could alone. Many of
      our founders attribute a meaningful part of their own success to the
      mentors and advisors who guided them along the way. Having achieved that
      success, they feel called to pay it forward. Through Supernova, exited
      founders gain the opportunity to invest and earn equity in growth-stage
      companies by contributing their battle-tested wisdom, operating
      experience, and social capital. In return, companies gain direct access to
      founders who have already navigated the challenges they now face.
      Supernova curates this engagement end-to-end. We source high-quality deal
      flow and present frictionless opportunities for our founders to
      participate—as advisors, mentors, investors, interim executives, or
      members of focused tiger teams. We handle all administration and
      back-office support, making Supernova a turnkey platform for high-leverage
      engagement and impact.
  - question: How does Supernova work with VCs & PE?
    answer: "Supernova acts as a force multiplier for modern VC and PE firms,
      helping them drive value creation in an era where returns are no longer
      driven by financial engineering alone, but by operational execution,
      talent, and speed. We go far beyond office hours, webinars, and
      traditional expert networks by giving portfolio companies direct access to
      the largest network of successfully exited founders and operators who have
      scaled and exited companies from $10M to $10B+, often in the same stage
      and industry your portfolio companies are navigating today. Supernova
      provides board-level operator leverage across the portfolio. Our exited
      founders don’t advise from the sidelines—they engage hands-on to help
      leadership teams move faster, make better decisions, and avoid costly
      mistakes at moments where execution risk is highest: post-acquisition
      stabilization, aggressive growth phases, executive transitions, AI and
      operational transformation, and exit preparation. Using NOVA, our
      proprietary AI matching engine, we diagnose each portfolio company’s most
      critical challenges and rapidly connect them with the right exited
      founders—often in minutes, not months—creating time compression and
      immediate execution lift. The data supports this model. Operational
      improvements are now the primary driver of PE returns, and nearly 70% of
      billion-dollar companies were built by repeat founders. Supernova
      institutionalizes that advantage, embedding outcome-driven operators who
      bring execution authority, pattern recognition, and personal
      accountability, delivering measurable EBITDA uplift, faster growth, and
      improved exits across the portfolio."
  - question: Why the name Supernova?
    answer: A single supernova shines hundreds of billions of times brighter than a
      single star. While one sun sustains life, a supernova reshapes entire
      galaxies. We believe it’s time for solo stars (successfully exited
      founders) to stop operating alone and start combining their energy,
      experience, and wisdom. When these founders align, something exponential
      happens. Insight compounds. Mistakes aren’t repeated. Momentum
      accelerates. Supernova exists to unite these founders into a living
      constellation—a founder flywheel where wisdom, capital, and execution move
      faster and cleaner through companies and ecosystems. Collaboration
      replaces competition. Experience becomes acceleration. Purpose becomes
      leverage. At its core, Supernova is about more than scaling companies.
      It’s about compounding wisdom instead of relearning pain, and helping
      founders build in a way that is worthy of the power they hold. Because the
      future won’t be shaped by those who shine alone, but by those who shine
      brighter together.
