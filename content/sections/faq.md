  - question: What is so special about Supernova?
    answer: If you are leading a growth stage company ($5MM to $100MM+), then you
      already know it doesn't get any easier the bigger you get. Scaling teams,
      entering new markets, bridging financing rounds, M&A, etc. The founders’
      journey to go the distance can be crazy complicated, but it doesn’t have
      to be. Our mission at Supernova is to accelerate the realization of the
      founder's vision from the only perspective that truly understands the
      journey, as exited founders ourselves. Stacking successfully exited
      founders on your team is a game-changer. They supply shortcuts, and cheat
      codes and help solve problems to help you get unstuck and accelerate
      speed-to-value. They fill specific needs - guidance, expertise,
      connections, mentorship, coaching and can even get hands-on serving in
      interim roles or tiger teams. 70% of unicorns were built by repeat
      founders of at least one previously successful company. That's why
      founders with multiple exits still tag in Supernova despite their past
      success because they know the advantage it brings when scaling their
      companies successfully.
  - question: Is Supernova accepting applications?
    answer: Yes, apply online to become one of the few companies we back each year.
      In 2026, we intend to back 10-12 Scaleups (Series A-C funding or
      bootstrapped to $5MM+ ARR) with up to $1M+ in capital, plus a tiger team
      of exited founders. Additionally, if we like what we see from
      earlier-stage companies, we'll deploy one or more of our existing founders
      to build relationships and accelerate key milestones. Supernova is
      agnostic, but has a proven track record in AI, Health Tech, Fintech, SaaS,
      eCommerce, Impact, and Web3. We are especially committed to supporting
      mission-driven companies solving modern-day problems.
  - question: How much does Supernova invest?
    answer: Every portfolio company in Supernova’s fund receives a check (up to
      $1M+). More importantly, each company is paired with 3–5 successfully
      exited founders, including Super Founders with prior exits of $50M+, who
      roll up their sleeves and work hands-on to accelerate critical milestones.
      As the saying goes, wisdom is more precious than gold. We don’t just
      invest capital—we transfer lived experience, especially when the stakes
      involve million-dollar decisions. Supernova is the top-rated
      advisory-as-a-service platform (90%+ NPS), with a proven track record of
      helping companies scale to unicorn and decacorn outcomes. Together, we
      build enduring companies and a legacy that extends far beyond business
      success.
  - question: What if I don’t have time for Supernova?
    answer: "Our guiding North Star is TIME. We don’t waste it—yours, your team’s,
      or our exited founders’. In fact, we invented Advisory-as-a-Service™ to
      formalize and streamline elite mentorship and advisory support. We start
      by precisely matching each Supernova exited founder to a member of your
      C-suite. For example, your CMO is paired with a successfully exited
      founder whose zone of genius directly addresses your most pressing
      opportunities and challenges. Leadership teams typically invest 5–10 hours
      per month and gain disproportionate returns through direct knowledge
      transfer—hard-won wisdom, pattern recognition, resources, and trusted
      relationships. Our founders are often brought in at moments that involve
      million-dollar decisions, helping teams move faster, avoid costly
      mistakes, and compound progress over time. If you feel “too busy” for
      Supernova, that’s usually the signal you need us most. "
  - question: Why do successfully exited founders join Supernova?
    answer: Supernova shares similarities with organizations like YPO—intimate,
      high-trust peer groups that serve as powerful sounding boards. The
      difference is that at Supernova, successfully exited founders don’t just
      talk about the game—they get back on the field together, helping scale
      real companies and sharing in the upside of successful outcomes. We are a
      peer network of 250+ exited founders who believe that, together, we can
      catalyze far more growth and impact than any of us could alone. Many of
      our founders attribute a meaningful part of their own success to the
      mentors and advisors who guided them along the way. Having achieved that
      success, they feel called to pay it forward. Through Supernova, exited
      founders gain the opportunity to invest and earn equity in growth-stage
      companies by contributing their battle-tested wisdom, operating
      experience, and social capital. In return, companies gain direct access to
      founders who have already navigated the challenges they now face.
      Supernova curates this engagement end-to-end. We source high-quality deal
      flow and present frictionless opportunities for our founders to
      participate—as advisors, mentors, investors, interim executives, or
      members of focused tiger teams. We handle all administration and
      back-office support, making Supernova a turnkey platform for high-leverage
      engagement and impact.
  - question: How does Supernova work with VCs?
    answer: Supernova helps VC’s go beyond office hours and webinars by providing
      access to the largest exited founder community of vetted advisors. A Tier
      1 VC partner of Supernova asked 100 founders in their portfolio, “How can
      we help?” Right behind sales growth, talent and funding, founders are
      begging for advisor and mentor support! Even top founders with elite VC
      backing want more output from them. Did you know? 70% of billion-dollar
      companies had repeat founders of at least one previously successful
      company. We serve as founder flywheels and help their teams scale success
      and impact.
  - question: Why is it called Supernova?
    answer: One Supernova shines 570 billion times brighter than the sun. One sun
      sustains all life on planet earth. We believe it’s time for solo stars
      (super founders) to combine their life force energy and shine brighter
      together. By serving as spokes on one founder flywheel, we move energy
      more powerfully and efficiently through startups and their ecosystems. We
      exist to unify our superpowers as quantum creators and play as one
      all-star team for venture humanity.🌟
