      **Founders build the future they wish to see.** They free us from our past
      by disrupting trillion-dollar industries. They are powerful creators or
      destroyers. They don’t have all the answers. They let few in their inner
      circle to influence decisions. Decisions that make or break realities and
      relationships.

      **Like our ancestors, it’s time they look to the stars to successfully
      navigate the hero’s journey.** The dark side of startup life is no joke.
      And, founders no longer have to do it all alone. After 4 Billion years of
      evolution, humanity is finally figuring out that collaboration is key.
      Given that Founders are among the most powerful creators on the planet,
      shouldn’t we? <br><br>At Supernova, our purpose is to be guiding lights.
      We shine brighter together as all-star teams backing founders dreams. And,
      united co-creating a supernova of oversized positive impact on the world.
