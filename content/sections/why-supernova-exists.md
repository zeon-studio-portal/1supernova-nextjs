      **Founders build the future they wish to see.** They free us from our
      past by disrupting trillion-dollar industries. They are powerful
      creators or destroyers. They don’t have all the answers. They let few in
      their inner circle to influence decisions. Decisions that make or break
      realities and relationships.

      **Like our ancestors, it’s time they look to the stars to successfully
      navigate the hero’s journey.** The dark side of startup life is no joke.
      And, founders no longer have to do it all alone. At Supernova, our
      purpose is to be guiding lights. Shining brighter together as we team up
      together as all-star teams backing founders dreams to accelerate key
      milestones and create a supernova of oversized impact on the world. ⭐
