Supernova respects your privacy and is committed to protecting the information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, how it may be shared, and the choices available to you.  
This Policy applies to your use of the Supernova platform, including NOVA AI, the Supernova Scorecard, Advisory-as-a-Service, and any related services.

### 1. Information We Collect

This information is collected to evaluate your company, provide platform services, and communicate with you. You are responsible for ensuring that submitted information is accurate and that you have the right to share it.

#### Information Collected Automatically

When you access the platform, we automatically collect certain technical and usage information, including:

- IP address and approximate location
- Device type, operating system, and browser

This data helps us operate the platform, maintain security, and understand how Supernova is used.

- Payment processors and financial service providers
- Analytics and security providers

Third-party data is used only in connection with providing and improving Supernova services and is handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### 2. How We Use Your Information

We use collected information to:

- Analyze company submissions and applications

- Evaluate companies for advisory or investment opportunities
- Improve and develop NOVA and platform functionality
- Communicate with users regarding services
- Monitor, maintain, and secure the platform

Supernova does not sell personal information. We use information solely to operate, improve, and protect our services.

### 3. NOVA AI and Third-Party Processing

NOVA AI is Supernova’s proprietary analytical system. In order to function, NOVA may rely on third-party AI or infrastructure providers for limited processing tasks.

These providers:

- Act solely as service providers
- Do not own your data
- Do not receive rights to use data for their own purposes
- Do not train their public models on your data

All scoring logic, analytical frameworks, interpretations, and outputs generated by NOVA are owned exclusively by Supernova.  
You acknowledge that AI-based processing is inherently probabilistic and that outputs are informational in nature.

### 4. Sharing Information with Advisors

Supernova may share relevant portions of submitted information with Advisors for the limited purposes of:

- Assessing potential fit
- Facilitating introductions
- Supporting active advisory engagements

Advisors are independent professionals and are bound by confidentiality obligations, but they are not employees or agents of Supernova. Supernova does not control how Advisors perform their services once engaged.

### 5. Use of Anonymized and Aggregated Data

Supernova may anonymize and aggregate data to:

- Improve NOVA AI and scoring methodologies
- Enhance matching and platform performance
- Conduct internal research on founder and company outcomes
- Train and refine internal analytical models

Anonymization removes identifiable and proprietary information prior to use. Anonymized data may be retained and used on an ongoing basis.

### 6. Data Retention

We retain information only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, including:

- Applications and Scorecards for approximately three (3) years
- Advisory engagement information for the duration of the engagement plus two (2) years
- Anonymized and aggregated data indefinitely

You may request deletion of your information, subject to legal, regulatory, or contractual retention obligations.

### 7. Security Measures

Supernova implements reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards, including:

- Encryption of data in transit and at rest
- Secure data transfer protocols
- Access controls and role-based permissions
- Monitoring and logging systems

No system can be guaranteed to be completely secure. You acknowledge that use of the platform involves inherent data transmission risks.

### 8. Your Privacy Rights

Depending on your location and applicable law, including California and European regulations, you may have the right to:

- Access personal information we hold about you
- Request correction of inaccurate information
- Request deletion of certain information
- Request a copy of your data
- Object to or restrict certain processing activities

Requests may be submitted to [privacy@1supernova.com](mailto:privacy@1supernova.com). We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling requests and may deny requests where permitted by law.

### 9. Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Supernova uses cookies and similar technologies to support analytics, functionality, and user experience.  
You may control cookies through your browser settings. Disabling cookies may limit certain features of the platform.

### 10. Children’s Privacy

Supernova services are not intended for individuals under the age of eighteen (18). We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.

### 11. International Data Transfers

Your information may be processed and stored in the United States or other jurisdictions that may have different data protection laws than your country of residence.  
By using the platform, you consent to the transfer and processing of information in these jurisdictions.

### 12. Policy Updates
