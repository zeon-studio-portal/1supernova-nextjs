Welcome to Supernova. We’re excited to support founders who are building meaningful companies and solving real problems in the world. These Terms explain how our platform works, including NOVA AI, our Scorecard, our expert founder network, Advisory-as-a-Service, and any investment-related activities. We’ve written this in straightforward, approachable language—while still protecting everyone involved.  
By accessing or using Supernova, you agree to these Terms.

### 1. What Supernova Is

Supernova is an expert network and technology platform designed to support company building and scaling. Supernova provides:

- NOVA AI, a proprietary artificial intelligence system that analyzes submitted materials and generates insights
- The Supernova Scorecard, a structured, internal analysis of risks, gaps, strengths, and opportunities
- Advisor matching, facilitating introductions to vetted, independent exited founders
- Advisory-as-a-Service, a structured advisory framework with defined expectations and accountability
- Selective investment consideration through affiliated investment entities

Supernova provides tools, frameworks, and access to people. Supernova does not provide legal, tax, accounting, investment, or financial advice, and does not act as a fiduciary. No information provided through the platform should be construed as professional advice or as a recommendation to take or refrain from any action.  
Use of Supernova does not create any agency, partnership, joint venture, employment, or fiduciary relationship. You remain solely responsible for all business, financial, and strategic decisions made in connection with your company.  
All guidance is informational. You make your own decisions.

### 2. Eligibility

To access or use Supernova, you represent and warrant that you:

- Are at least eighteen (18) years old
- Have full authority to bind the company you represent
- Provide accurate, current, and complete information
- Will comply with all applicable laws and regulations

Supernova reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend or terminate access for misuse, misrepresentation, abuse of the platform, or violation of these Terms.

### 3. Submissions and Use of Information

When you submit materials to Supernova, including pitch decks, financial information, documents, data, URLs, videos, or written content, you grant Supernova a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to:

- Review, store, and process submitted materials
- Analyze submissions using NOVA AI and Supernova’s proprietary frameworks
- Utilize third-party infrastructure and AI tools to facilitate processing and analysis
- Generate analytical outputs, including the Supernova Scorecard
- Share relevant portions with Advisors for evaluation and matching
- Evaluate your company for advisory or potential investment opportunities
- Use anonymized and aggregated data to improve Supernova’s systems and models

We do not claim ownership of your company information. You retain ownership of your original submissions. Supernova retains exclusive ownership of all analyses, outputs, models, frameworks, methodologies, and derivative works created from or based on your submissions.  
You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to submit the materials, that submissions do not violate confidentiality obligations or applicable laws, and that submissions do not include regulated, protected, or sensitive personal data. You acknowledge that submitted information may be processed outside your jurisdiction and that Supernova is not responsible for restrictions imposed by third-party agreements or laws you are subject to.

### 4. NOVA AI

NOVA AI is Supernova’s proprietary analytical system built on internal scoring frameworks, pattern recognition, and insights derived from exited-founder experience and historical operational data.  
NOVA may use third-party AI tools solely as processing infrastructure. All scoring logic, interpretations, methodologies, and outputs are owned exclusively by Supernova.  
You acknowledge and agree that AI-generated outputs are probabilistic in nature, may contain inaccuracies, and are not audited, validated, or guaranteed. NOVA outputs are informational only and are not prescriptive. You agree not to rely solely on NOVA outputs when making business, financial, or strategic decisions.  
Supernova expressly disclaims all responsibility and liability arising from reliance on AI-generated insights or interpretations.

### 5. The Supernova Scorecard

The Supernova Scorecard is a proprietary analysis intended to provide directional insights into a company’s strengths, risks, gaps, and opportunities.  
The Scorecard:

- Is informational and non-binding
- Does not guarantee funding, performance, or outcomes
- Is confidential and provided solely for internal evaluation

It is for your internal use only.

### 6. Advisor Matching and Non-Circumvention

Advisors introduced through Supernova are independent contractors and are not employees, agents, or representatives of Supernova.  
Supernova does not guarantee Advisor availability, performance, engagement quality, or outcomes.  
All Advisor introductions facilitated by Supernova are deemed Supernova-originated relationships. You agree that for a period of twenty-four (24) months from the date of introduction, you will not bypass, circumvent, or engage any introduced Advisor outside of the Supernova platform for advisory, consulting, employment, fundraising, contracting, or other commercial purposes.  
A breach of this section may result in immediate termination of access, loss of future services or investment consideration, and entitlement to injunctive relief. This obligation survives termination of these Terms.

### 7. Investment-Related Activities

Advisor matching or platform participation does not imply or guarantee investment.  
Any investment consideration by Supernova or affiliated entities is separate from platform services and governed by independent agreements. Nothing on the platform constitutes an offer, solicitation, or recommendation to invest, and no investment decisions should be inferred from platform activity.  
Supernova is not a broker, dealer, or investment advisor.

### 8. Confidentiality and Security

Supernova implements reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information, including encryption and access controls.  
You acknowledge that no system is perfectly secure and that data transmission carries inherent risk. Supernova is not liable for unauthorized access, interruptions, or breaches outside of its reasonable control.

### 9. Intellectual Property

Supernova retains all right, title, and interest in and to:

- NOVA AI
- Supernova Scorecards
- Algorithms, scoring frameworks, and methodologies
- Platform technology, branding, interfaces, and content

Nothing in these Terms grants you any license or rights to Supernova intellectual property except as expressly permitted for use of the platform.

### 10. No Guarantees

Supernova makes no representations or guarantees regarding funding, revenue, growth, Advisor outcomes, accuracy of analyses, valuations, or business success.  
All services are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis.

### 11. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Supernova shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages arising out of or related to use of the platform.  
Supernova’s total aggregate liability is limited to the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or the fees paid by you in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. You assume all risk associated with use of the platform.

### 12. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Supernova from any claims, damages, losses, or expenses arising from your misuse of the platform, violation of these Terms, unlawful or infringing submissions, or disputes with Advisors.

### 13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by the laws of the Delaware, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.  
Any dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco, California, in English. You waive any right to a jury trial or class action.

### 15. Updates

Supernova may update these Terms periodically. Continued use of the platform constitutes acceptance of any updated Terms.

### 16. Miscellaneous

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Supernova. If any provision is held invalid, the remaining provisions remain in full force. Supernova may assign these Terms without restriction. Provisions relating to intellectual property, liability, indemnification, non-circumvention, and dispute resolution survive termination. Supernova is not liable for events beyond its reasonable control.
