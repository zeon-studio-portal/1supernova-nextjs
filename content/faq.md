  - question: "Why do startups need advisors?"
    answer: "The founders’ journey is complicated, but it doesn’t have to be. The right advisory relationships can help game startup success. Advisors fill specific needs, be it guidance, expertise, connections, mentorship, and even hands-on support. They supply shortcuts, cheat codes and help solve problems that can make or break businesses. "

  - question: "Is my company a fit for Supernova?"
    answer: "To best serve the companies we work with and ensure impact, we limit our annual portfolio growth to 12 high-growth, high-potential startups, most often in Series A-C funding. Supernova advisors specialize primarily in AI, Health Tech, Fintech, SaaS, eCommerce, Impact and Web3. We are especially committed to supporting  ventures that take an innovative approach to solving modern-day problems."

  - question: "Who would my advisors be?"
    answer: "You’ll be matched  with six to eight exited founders that have relevant expertise with your company's near term priorities. As your needs evolve, so does your advisory team. Advisors are incentivized by earning equity based on performance and are held accountable to our high standards in advisory excellence that value the achievement of measurable milestones. "

  - question: "What if I don’t have time for my advisors?"
    answer: "If you are too busy for us, then you likely need Supernova more than you realize! Typically, Founder/CEOs invest three to five hours of effort a month, and see a significant return on the relationship. We bring proven methods, collaborative technology and expert resources to maximize shared efficiencies as your advisory team."

  - question: "How does Supernova compare with traditional advisors?"
    answer: "Most founders and startups struggle to recruit, engage, manage and incentivize their advisory boards. All too often they settle or allow their advisors to sit idle on the sidelines with little accountability. This despite giving away 5%+ company equity to their advisors over the lifetime of the business. Supernova is a turnkey solution for curating, managing, incentivizing and holding accountable your advisory board."

  - question: "What makes Supernova so different?"
    answer: "Supernova is the future of startup advising. We are the first and only resource able to curate successfully exited entrepreneurs and adapt that team to serve the evolving priorities and challenges of your company. Our mission is to accelerate the realization of the founder's vision from the only perspective that truly understands the journey, as founders ourselves."

  - question: "How much does Supernova charge?"
    answer: "Supernova’s advisory service model is charged as a monthly, at-will subscription along with an equity allocation. We are held accountable to delivering measurable value by supporting critical decision making and initiatives that generate incremental gains in sales, partnerships, hiring, funding, and/or company valuation. For example, an early stage, Series A startup may invest 1% equity annually, plus a $10K monthly subscription. We are highly incentivized to see founders and their startups succeed quickly."


  - question: "Why are exited founders motivated to advise through Supernova?"
    answer: "Supernova advisors have achieved success in their careers in some part thanks to the help they received along the way. In realizing that success, they are moved to pay forward the support and guidance they once received as a founder and see the personal value in giving back to others that are in the position they once were. By working with Supernova, they are catalyzing more growth than what they could accomplish on their own. Supernova is curating opportunities to work with top startups for the exited founder, and making it easier for them to manage the day-to-day administration and incentive elements of advising. Similar to a lawyer joining a firm, or a doctor working in a practice versus doing it on their own, there are benefits to working with Supernova that help them to be a more effective advisor."


  - question: "How does Supernova work with VCs?"
    answer: "Supernova helps VC’s go beyond office hours and webinars by providing access to the largest exited founder community of vetted advisors. A Tier 1 VC partner of Supernova asked 100 founders in their portfolio, “How can we help?” Right behind sales growth, talent and funding, founders are begging for advisor and mentor support! Even top founders with elite VC backing want more output from their advisory boards, and Supernova is able to serve as a VC partner that produces higher satisfaction for all."


  - question: "Why is it called Supernova?"
    answer: "One Supernova shines 570 billion times brighter than the sun. One sun sustains all life on planet earth. We believe it’s time for solo stars founders to combine their life force energy and shine brighter together with Supernova. By serving as spokes on one founder flywheel, we move energy more powerfully and efficiently through startups and their ecosystems. We exist to unify our superpowers as quantum creators and play as one all-star team for venture humanity. Let’s light up the world.🌟"
