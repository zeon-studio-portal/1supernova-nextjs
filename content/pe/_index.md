  title: ✨ A managed system for results ✨
  subtitle: "Supernova isn't a loose network of advisors. It's a structured
    operating system designed to turn existing founder expertise into measurable
    outcomes. "
  comparison_table:
    - category: Structured matching
      traditional: "We diagnose portfolio needs fast, and match exited founders based
        on stage, pattern recognition, and prioritized results - not
        availability. "
      supernova: Immediate diagnosis; parallel execution; iterate daily.
    - category: Managed execution
      traditional: "Every engagement is run through a defined framework with clear
        objectives and OKRS. "
