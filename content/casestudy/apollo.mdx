### Company Overview

[Apollo Neuro](https://apolloneuro.com/) is the first vibration therapy system **clinically proven** to reduce stress, improve sleep, and restore the nervous system.

### Growth-Stage Opportunity

Apollo launched with a consumer wearable and **grew to $10MM+ in annual revenues**. However, the company realized a massive opportunity to expand into a multi-factor platform to scale and positively impact more live. This critical transition required additional capital, expanding revenue streams, proving GTM success, refactoring the team, and achieving key company milestones.

### Supernova Impact

* **LEADERSHIP** - Referred and placed an Interim-CFO (former CFO of Beats By Dre; Sold to Apple) to lead financial planning and scenarios for a clear path to profitability (targeting a Series B round in 2025).
* **FUNDING** - Supernova's exited founders accelerated the closing of a Series A ($30MM) by directly investing $350K, revamping the pitch deck, financials, deal room, investor outreach,  [Supernova demo days](https://kern.al/event/supernova-demo-day), and actively supporting meetings with insiders and VC's.
* **GROWTH -** Supported growth goals in sales and marketing to grow revenues to almost $1M ARR monthly (August 2024); projected 75% YoY growth. 130K customers and growing (100K 5-star reviews); highly engaged, with an average use of 4.5 hours/day and active retention of over 80% after 12 months.
* **PARTNERSHIPS** - Referred and closed licensing deals to leverage Apolloâ€™s patented software and prove it's hardware-agnostic and can be delivered through mobile phones, wearables, and any haptic devices that vibrate, such as headphones and smart beds.
* **GTM** - Diversified revenue streams: 1.) Apollo wearable (MRSP $349 with 76% gross margin) and 2.) AI Vibes ($199.99 device-as-a-service annual subscription). 3.) Apollo LITE (phone-only subscription $9.99/mo). 4.) Enterprise sales deals (B2B)
* **COMMUNITY** - Spearheaded a [$1MM+ Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/apolloneuro/apollo-20-the-future-of-personalized-well-being) to pre-sell products for a Gen 2 launch by leveraging the Apollo community.
